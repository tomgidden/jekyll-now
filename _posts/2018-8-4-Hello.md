<p>
  This is my homepage, blog, site, or whatever you want to call it.
</p>

<p>
  I haven't got any blog posts here yet.  This page shouldn't really be
  visible, but I've got nothing to hide.  Most of my recent writings have
  ended up on <a href="https://medium.com/@gid/latest">Medium</a> instead.
  However, if I do start managing my own blog, this is where it might end
  up.
</p>

<p>
  In the meantime, to find out more about me, it's probably worth checking
  out <a href="/">the front page</a>.
